# NASA_Wallpaper
NASA has posted a new picture - occasionally video which cannot be set as wallpaper - each day since the 16th of June 1995. How awesome is that!!?
This program fetches an image of the day from [NASA's archive] (http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html) and sets it automatically as your windows wallpaper.

Files are stored in your local "/user/Pictures/NASA Wallpapers" folder.

Project developed in Visual Studio 2015
